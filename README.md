# timeseries-ml-debugger


This project explores simple tools to help understand why machine learning models fail during training and evaluation, especially on time-series data.

The initial focus is on detecting common issues such as overfitting by analyzing training behavior and performance metrics.

This repository is currently in an early exploratory stage and will grow incrementally.

## What is Overfitting?

Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs very well on training data but poorly on unseen data. This usually means the model has memorized patterns specific to the training set instead of learning generalizable features.
